# Summary of week 06


##Adrien : 
I started implementing the back-end part of the voice call. I spent time on documentation and started the code but not enough for making a pull request.
I estimated 16 hours of work on this task so I didn't finish yet but the time estimate should be accurate.
Next week I'll keep working on the same task in order to make a pull request at the end of the week hopefully.


##Youssef :
This week I took care of adding the functionnality of changing the dates on which we want to see the appointments

My time estimation for implementing the feature was correct, but I spend a lot of time refactoring the tests so they can work on the emulated database;
this was done to get rid of mentions of the fake user in the main code.

For the next sprint, I'll try to let users see public appointments so that they can join them if they want; I'll have to do some refactoring, to change
my calendar activity to make it work with fragments.


##Mathis :
This week, I implemented the fact that users can now be banned from the meetings, and that appointments may be private. I also helped Youssef debug his code.
Next week I will begin on working on the sharing of images in a chat.
I think the time estimates were mostly accurate.

##LÃ©o:

I refactored the appointment creation to fragments, which makes it easier to understand for the users and better do deal with while programming in the future.

My time estimate was not accurate, it didn't take me as long as I thought it would. This is because I never dealt with fragments before so I thought it would take a long time to understand and read the documentation, and adapt the tests.

Next time, I'll improve my time estimates.


##Thomas:
This week I wanted to implement the reminder notification in a way that was consistent with the database. 

In a first implementation to get a feel of how the database listener works without using the interface, I managed to get it to work. However, using the database interface, it did not work and I am still trying to get it to work with the interface.
the interface. Since I have already worked more than 11 hours. My time estimate was not correct.

Next time I will continue to implement the reminder notification with the interface. From now on I will only use our given interface
to make my work because this is the only work that will remain in the main version and therefore it is the only important work.

## Overal team:

Thanks to the hardwork of everyone, we are improving a lot our app. 

I feel that in general the team is trying to improve the already written code so that in the future we can advance with a good code. We have also improve this week the overall user experience of the current functionalities 
,in the big picture mostly trying to make the user experience better without adding new functionnality. At the same we are doing work that do not result in a new functionnality in this week, but it 
will in the future.


Next time, I hope we will finally add the remaining blocks to add all the functionnalities we had in mind and work during this spring.
