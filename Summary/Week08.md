# Summary of week 08


## Adrien
I worked on the Voicecall, I implemented the possibility for users to see who is in the call and who is muted.

My time estimation was fine.

Next I will improve the Voicecall by making it more efficient.


## Youssef
This week my task was to add the possibility of video chatting.

Unfortunately the task looked more time consuming than I expected, partly do to research on the Agora API and some refactoring.

As such, I wasn't able to finish implementation this week, and I will take the next week as well to try and finish it.

## Mathis 
This week I worked on fixing Out-of Memory errors that were caused by the way we handled listeners. It was fixed by adding a way for listeners to be called once and then discarded immediately. 
I had some extra time so I improved existing tests to bring the coverage from 81 to 85%.

The time estimations were pessimistic this week, I will try to improve this as we keep going.

Next week, I will add support to the database to invite users to appointments instead of adding them directly.

## LÃ©o (Scrum Meister)
I created a new activity allowing the user to see all their invitations, and accept or refuse them. For now this isn't connected to the database
since it doesn't support it and this will be done next week.

My time estimate was accurate.

Next time, I'll connect the activity I created to the database and add the UI support of a new feature : a pre-defined list of courses, so that when a user
wants to select the course, they can only choose among a given list, which will make it much easier to look through public appointments for a specific course.

## Thomas 


## Sami
I connected the picture sharing backend to the room UI. I also started to work on the theme.

My time estimation was good. However, I focused on implementing picture sharing, so I finished this instead of finishing the theme.

Next time, I will focus on adding a way to modify pictures before sending them and Thomas will continue my work on the theme.

## Overall team

Once again everyone did a great job of implementing new features.

We are steadily moving towards being done with almost all of the most important features and it looks very promising.

We now know how to work during a scrum so next week should go as smoothly as this one.
