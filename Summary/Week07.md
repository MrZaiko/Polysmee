# Summary of week 07


## Adrien (Scrum Master)
I implemented the back-end part of the voice call and linked it to the front-end of the room.
My time estimation was correct.
Next time I'll keep working on the voice call feature and improve it.


## Youssef
This sprint there were two things I had to do: change the calendar activity so it uses fragments, and add a fragment to show public appointments.

My time estimation was an hour bit off the spot this sprint, as there was some refactoring I did to take into account this new functionnality, and for some performance gain.

Next week, I'll try to add the possibility to share video streams to implement a video call functionnality.


## Mathis 
This week, I have been working on getting the file transfers done, so that we can in the future implement in-chat picture transfers. 
I also implemented the ability to remove listeners on the firebase database to avoid some outOfMemory errors we had been encountering (on cirrus especially :))
I respected the 8h limit fairly well. Next week, I will create an activity to logout of firebase and begin working on a solution to invite people to appointments, but I don’t expect to be done at that point.

## Léo

I added suggestions when inviting or banning a user from an appointment. This way one does not need to know someone's exact name on the app to invite/ban them.

My time estimate was slightly inaccurate since I tried to check how to do this before this sprint, and the only way I had found seemed to require creating several classes and to be quite complex. But when I actually started implementing it I found an easier way which took me slightly less time.

Next time, I'll add the ability to see if someone invited you to their appointment


## Thomas 
This week I finally terminated notification reminder so that it is coherent with the online database.

My estimate for 2 week sprint was not accurate as I did in 2 week what I thought I would do in 1 week. I founded that my implementation was not working because it was too long since I did not merge main into this branch.
When I merge main to my branch it work, I lost a lot of time trying to debug something that was working.

Next time before trying to debug I will check that my branches has not been out of sync with the main branch for too long as we might have found a bug in it and fix it.

## Sami
I finished the UI update. I also implemented the UI support for room call.

I overestimated the time needed to add support for room call. However, since the UI update was more time-consuming than expected, 
everything balanced out, exceeding only by one hour the 8 hours planned.

Next time, I'll create a more elegant color theme as well as adding UI support for the picture.

## Overall team
After this two week sprint, the app got many improvements.

I feel like the team is progressing very fast, new features have been added and the UI now looks great.

Next time I believe we will keep going this way in order to finish implementing the main features.
