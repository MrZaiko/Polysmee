# Summary of week 04

## LÃ©o

I completely connected the appointment creation to the database. Now the appointment will appear on the database will everything set up correctly

My time estimate was accurate, however one small thing i planned to do turned out to not be a "need to have" so i didn't do it, so I may have been over estimate if i did.

Next time, I'll keep trying to extimate the time correctly

## Sami (Scrum Master)

Like past week, I improved the room activity by restraining the modification of the room to the owner only. I also linked the send, edit and delete messages functionnality 
developped by Adrien to the UI. We finally have a fully functionnal room.

Again, my time estimation was accurate but I did not take into account the time needed to do the demo, so I ended up working 10 hours instead of 8.

Next time, I will try to improve the layout of each activity to make the whole app looks better.

## Youssef

I added to the calendar activity the possibility to click on a created appointment to join its room, as well as managing the users from the appointment's details

This week, my time estimation was on point; I did my 8 hours almost exactly.

Next week, I'll try to implement the possibility for the user to select any date they want, and let them see that day's appointment.

## Overall team:

Thanks to the hardwork of everyone, we are finally getting really close to have all the core features of our app. 

I feel like the team is trying to improve the communication issues we encountered so assembling the work of everyone for everyone is easier.

Next time, I hope we will finally add the remaining blocks (mainly notifications) and improve the global look and feel of the app.
