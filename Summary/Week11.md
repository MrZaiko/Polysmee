# Summary of week 11

## Sami
This week, I first worked on the calendar. Sadly, I did not manage to link our calendar to google calendar in time. I also added profile picture in the rooms 
(messages and participants).

This week, my time estimate was very off. I underestimated the time needed to sync the calendar with google calendar which took me more than 15 hours instead 
of 8 (the task is not even finished).

Next week, I will finish to sync the calendar.

## Youssef (SM)
This week I refactored the user profile, adding support for a profile picture as well. Not only we can see our own profile, but also other users.

I took a bit time this sprint because I had to refactor some tests, but on my task alone my time estimate was correct.

Next week I'll try to manage my time better, as it took me way too much for the refactorings.

## LÃ©o
I improved the UI for the invitations activity.

My time estimate was accurate.

Next time, I'll keep trying to extimate the time correctly.

## Adrien
I implemented the front end of the offline mode and I refactored the classes that use listeners in order to remove them.

My time estimate was quite accurate.

Next time I'll try to implement the tests earlier in the week.

## Thomas
This sprint I adapted the voice tuner setting so that it is consistent with the rest of the UI.I also fix a security bug with the appointment reminder notification.


My time estimate was not good this week, since it was the first time I used AlertDialog and it was more complicated that what I thought. I also wanted to fix another possible bug, but since I already worked 12h30 this week I didn't fix it.

Next time, if I know I will encounter a new thing to me. I will try my best not to underestimate the time needed.

# Mathis 
This week, I implemented two things: i changed the sign-in method to use Google instead of our custom solution, so that Sami could work on getting data to Google calendar, as part of our destabilization sprint. I also added a logo to our app, to create a visual identity, and reworked the login screen so that it detects when the user is offline for their first login.

I estimated the time it took fairly correctly.

Next week, I will work on getting the images cached so that the app does not have to download them every time it needs them.

# Overall
The work done by the team this week was good once again, I don't have any particular comments to add.
