# Summary of week 13

## Sami
This week, I worked on the messages reactions. I implemented both the front and backend.

My time estimate was perfect.

Next week, I will refactor some methods, add comments, change some views to finalize the app and make it perfect for the submission.

## Youssef
This week I took care of implementing an invitation system for the friends, and fixing à bug related to bans on the public calendar.

My time estimation was correct 

Next week I'll try to reformat and clean the code related to the calendar activity, and other activities that I have written, so the final code is the cleanest possible

## Léo (SM)
I made it so that the app asks for permissions whenever necessary. It doesn't crash anymore when it can't access the camera for example.

My time estimate was a bit too high.

Next time I will help polish the code with comments, javadoc...

## Adrien
I implemented the possibility to sort the public appointments by number of participants and the number of participants is now displayed.

My time estimate was accurate.

Next week I will clean the code

## Thomas
This sprint I wanted to implement the feature that would allow users to give nicknames to their friends. But I couldn't manage to do it after 14h of work.

It turned out that the feature was quite complex to implement, and I would need more time. Most of the complexity was from the multiple thread that needed to work together.

Next time, I will give more thought before choosing and starting to work on a new feature as sometime the devil is in the details, but we can spot quite early that it will take much more time than we thought in the first place.

# Mathis 
This week, I worked on multiple small patches that should have been done fairly easily. Most of them were, but the last one (the logout button) proved to be much more difficult to write as Cirrus was reaching its own limits and running into OutOfMemory errors constantly. Debugging these proved to be time-consuming as Cirrus is basically a very unreliable black box. I ended up creating a new branch and redoing the commits one by one to understand the bug and remove it. 
I also worked on creating a readme that is not merged yet.

My time estimates were inaccurate but I do not blame myself for these, I wish we used a more robust CI / a private one. 

Next week, I will finish the readme and refactor our code so that it is more readable.

# Overall
The work done by the team this week was good once again, I don't have any particular comments to add.
