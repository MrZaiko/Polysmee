# Summary of week 03 

## LÃ©o
I connected the invitations to the database and I added the feature of having pre-defined courses and preventing users from creating appointments with other courses than those on the database.

My time estimate was accurate.

Next time, I'll keep trying to make good time estimates
## Mathis 
This week I worked on getting the invitation system working. Now, when a user creates an appointment, he cannot directly add people into it, but needs to ask the guest first. This works fine and has a GUI made by Leo.
I think I got the time estimate right this week, and will work to keep it that way.
Next week, I will work on investigating how we can implement the offline mode for the user.
## Adrien
I implemented the possibility for the users to see who is talking when they are in a call, I also added a Timecode to the database so that users that lose connection or kill the app while they are in a call won't appear in call anymore.

My time estimate wasn't so good this time, I've been too ambitious on the tasks that I  took so I didn't finish one.

Next time I will keep working on the voice call in order to improve it.

## Thomas (Scrum Master)
This sprint I implemented a way for the user to change the theme of the application, notably a change from light mode to dark mode. And I patch some test for the notification that I work on last weeks.
My time estimate for this week was even better, I work 8 hours.
Next time, I hope again to manage well my time
## Sami
I added the picture edition functionality.

This week, my time estimate was perfect. I manage to do and test everything in 8 hours as expected.

Next time, I'll modify the UI for picture editing and video calls.
## Youssef
This week my task was to finish adding video chatting.

I could finally finish implementing the functionality, which took around 20h in total (a bit more than the 16 hours of two sprints). 

Next week I'll implement a "friends" system, that is let the current user either add another user as a friend from some menu in the settings, or add them directly while being in the same room.
## Overall team
I found that this week the team was really efficient, in general, they all managed to do a correct time estimate. I had no complaint at all or problem to underlined
