This week, I finished the google calendar integration.

Unlike the past week, my time estimate was good.

Next week, I'll try to finalize the export calendar UI.

## Overall team

I think that the team has done a very good work. In particular, everyone tries to create their PR 
at least one or two days before Tuesday which makes the merge process much more efficient.
