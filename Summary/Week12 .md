# Summary of week 12

## LÃ©o
I implemented a proper support for landscape mode throughout the app (with a noted exception for the video call since most videos will be in portrait mode anyway).

My time estimate was accurate.

Next time, I'll keep trying to extimate the time correctly

## Mathis 

This week, I worked on getting the cache working, so that pictures are not downloaded every time they are needed. This took me quite a while to get tight, as the filesystem on Android proved to be quite difficult to work with. I ended up working a solution that uses app-specific storage, which is much less of a hassle.
I ended up working more than expected on the filesystem, so I dropped working on the two smaller other tasks I had planned for this week. I will postpone them to the coming one.
Next week, I will fix bugs that are related to the login system, the database, and the cache of this week.

## Adrien
I implemented the leave/delete appointment option

My time estimate was accurate on my task but I spent more than 8 hours fixing cirrus

Next time I'll try to push my code more often in order to make sure that I discover faster why the cirrus tests fail

## Thomas 
This sprint I implemented the profile description for users.

My time estimate for the work was perfect, I spend 8 hours.

Next time, I will try to do as well as I have done this week.

## Sami (Scrum Master)
This week, I finished the google calendar integration.

Unlike the past week, my time estimate was good.

Next week, I'll try to finalize the export calendar UI.

## Youssef
This week I took care of refactoring the friend screen by now showing the friends with their profile picture next to their names, and by customizing the user search bar so that we can see their profile picture as well when searching for them (in order to differentiate between the different users).

The time estimation was correct

Next week, I'll fix a bug about the banned participants and public appointments, and change the friend system to work on invitations instead

## Overall team

I think that the team has done a very good work. In particular, everyone tries to create their PR 
at least one or two days before Tuesday which makes the merge process much more efficient.
