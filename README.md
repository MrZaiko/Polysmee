# Polysmee
Polysme is an Android application that lets you discover new student communities, and communicate with your friends in one single unified application.
It was built for the EPFL CS-306 "Software Development Project" course.

## What it does

Polysmee lets you create and join appointments, which may be public (anybody can join) or private (the owner decides who joins).

These appointments enable users to chat and communicate through audio and/or video.

Polysmee supports, among other things, picture sharing, notifications for appointments and synchronization of your appointments to calendar apps such as Google Calendar.

## How it works

This application uses two main cloud service providers : [Google Firebase](firebase.google.com) and [Agora](agora.io).
